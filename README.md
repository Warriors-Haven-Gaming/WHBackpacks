# Warriors Haven Backpacks

This Arma 3 mod adds high-capacity variants of existing backpacks. No fuss.

We made this mod as an alternative to SN Carryall Backpack Lite and THC_Backpacks
since they both have a hidden script that disables stamina, reduces recoil and sway,
makes players harder for AI to spot, and negates player ratings.
We also noticed some UIs break from THC_Backpacks, like the ACE Addon Mismatch dialog
not appearing, and the Zeus interface missing all units.
This mod skips all of that and simply creates the backpack variants, nothing else.

In the arsenal, you can find this mod's backpacks near the bottom with the WHB prefix:
- WHB Assault Packs (160 => 480, increased 3x)
- WHB Carryall Backpacks (320 => 1000, increased 2.125x)
